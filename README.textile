"ZooKeeper is a high-performance coordination service for distributed applications. It exposes common services - such as naming, configuration management, synchronization, and group services - in a simple interface so you don't have to write them from scratch. You can use it off-the-shelf to implement consensus, group management, leader election, and presence protocols. And you can build on it for your own, specific needs."

zk-smoketest.py provides a simple smoketest client for a ZooKeeper ensemble. Useful for verifying new, updated, existing installations.

h2. Overview

This tool uses the ZooKeeper python binding to exercise the server. In general the script does the following:

# create a root znode for the test, i.e. /zk-smoketest
# attach a zk session to each server in the ensemble (the --servers list)
# each client will create ephemeral znodes and attach watches on znodes of the other clients
# each client will then delete the the ephemeral znodes it owns, all clients verify watches are triggered properly
# client then cleans up, removing /zk-smoketest znode

h2. Usage

<code>
PYTHONPATH=lib.linux-i686-2.6 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=lib.linux-i686-2.6 ./zk-smoketest.py --servers "host:port(,host:port)*"
</code>

*Note*: you may need to compile the zookeeper python binding, this project includes only the linux binaries.
